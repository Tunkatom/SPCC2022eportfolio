    <div class="bodyText"><p>I like to fence, I think it's a great sport. I started to learn about the
        second semester in eighth grade. However, if I don't fight as hard as I can, I won't beat 
        as many people as I could.â€‹ I won't place the highest. Like with fencing, is my studies. If
        I don't study and pay attention in class, I won't have as good grades as I could and 
        succeed.</p>
        <p>This is my story, where you learn some things about me, my life, my hobbies, and my studies. 
        The later pages will go more into depth about me and my studies, seeing as this is just a crouton
        on a salad. This ePortfolio serves as a sort of digital suitcase for my accomplishments and my
        work. To show me off to my future employers and educators.</p></div>
